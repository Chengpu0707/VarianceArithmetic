Dear Eiditor of Numerical Algorithms:

There is only one comment from the only reviwer:
"This manuscript (research article rather than a tutorial) is TEDIOUSLY written. It is SERIOUSLY suggested to be made contributions clear and concise to readers."

I have rewriten the paper, to cut its length from 86 pages to 37 pages.  I have also ask an editorial service (Editage) to refine my draft twice.  I hope that this change can satisfy the reviewer's request.  I am looking forward for more communications from you.

Thank you very much for your help!
Regards,
Dr, Chengpu Wang
